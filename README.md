Rel-Payment add-on for Firefox
=======

The Rel-Payment add-on for Firefox enables easy discovery and donations/payments to pages you visit in your browser.

## How to build

This add-on uses [Mozilla's Add-on SDK](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/builder). Download that and [install it](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/dev-guide/tutorials/installation.html) accordingly.

When you have both the Addon SDK and tyou're ready to run and build this add-on, then you can read how to do that in the the Add-on SDK [Getting Started tutorial](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/dev-guide/tutorials/getting-started-with-cfx.html) to find out how that is done.
